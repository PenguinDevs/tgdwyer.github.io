title: "Functor and Applicative"
---

In this chapter we see how the Haskell language features we introduced in previous chapters (from function application rules based on [Lambda Calculus](/lambdacalculus) to [Typeclasses](/haskell2#typeclasses)) lead to highly flexible and refactorable code and powerful abstractions.

## Learning Outcomes

- Understand how [eta-conversion](#eta-conversion), [operator sectioning](#operator-sectioning) and [compose](#compose) together provide the ability to transform code to achieve a composable [point-free](#point-free-code) form and use this technique to refactor code
- Understand that in Haskell the ability to map over container structures is generalised into the [Functor](#functor) typeclass, such that any type that is an instance of Functor has the `fmap` or `(<$>)` operation
- Understand that the [Applicative Typeclass](#applicative) extends Functor such that containers of functions may be applied (using the `(<*>)` operator) to containers of values
- Understand that Functor and Applicative allow powerful composable types through exploring a [simple applicative functor for parsing](#a-simple-applicative-functor-for-parsing)

## Refactoring Cheatsheet

The following equivalences make many refactorings possible in Haskell:

### Eta Conversion

Exactly as per [Lambda Calculus](/lambdacalculus):

```haskell
f x ≡ g x
f   ≡ g
```

### Operator Sectioning

Remember Haskell binary operators are just infix curried functions of two parameters and that putting brackets around them makes them prefix instead of infix.

```haskell
x + y ≡ (+) x y
      ≡ ((+) x) y  -- making function application precedence explicit
      ≡ (x+) y     -- binary operators can also be partially applied
```

Such operator sectioning allows us to get the right-most parameter of the function on its own at the right-hand side of the body expression such that we can apply eta conversion, thus:

```haskell
f x = 1 + x
f x = (1+) x
f = (1+)             -- eta conversion
```

### Compose

Has its own operator in Haskell `(.)`, inspired by the mathematical function composition symbol `∘`:

```haskell
 (f ∘ g) (x) ≡ f (g(x)) -- math notation
 (f . g) x ≡ f (g x)    -- Haskell
```

Again, this gives us another way to get the right-most parameter on its own outside the body expression:

```haskell
f x = sqrt (1 / x)
f x = sqrt ((1/) x)     -- operator section
f x = (sqrt . (1/)) x   -- by the definition of composition
f = sqrt . (1/)         -- eta conversion
```

</div>

## Point-Free Code

We have discussed point-free and tacit coding style earlier in these notes. In particular, eta-conversion works in Haskell the same as in lambda calculus and for curried JavaScript functions.  It is easy to do and usually declutters code of unnecessary arguments, e.g.:

```haskell
lessThan :: (Ord a) => a -> [a] -> [a]
lessThan n aList = filter (<n) aList
```

The following is more concise, and once you are used to reading Haskell type definitions, just as self-evident:

```haskell
lessThan :: (Ord a) => a -> [a] -> [a]
lessThan n = filter (<n)
```

But the above still has an argument (a point), `n`.  Can we go further?

It is possible to be more aggressive in refactoring code to achieve point-free style by using the compose operator `(.)`:

```haskell
(.) :: (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> a -> c
(f . g) x = f (g x)
```

To see how to use `(.)` in `lessThan` we need to refactor it to look like the right-hand side of the definition above, i.e. `f (g x)`.  For `lessThan`, this takes a couple of steps, because the order we pass arguments to `(<)` matters.  Partially applying infix operators like `(<n)` is called operator sectioning.  Placing `n` after `<` means that it is being passed as the second argument to the operator, which is inconvenient for eta-conversion.  Observe that `(<n)` is equivalent to `(n>)`, so the following is equivalent to the definition above:

```haskell
lessThan n = filter (n>)
```

Now we can use the non-infix form of (>):

```haskell
lessThan n = filter ((>) n)
```

And we see from [our definition of compose](#compose), that if we were to replace filter by `f`, `(>)` by `g`, and `n` by `x`, we would have exactly the definition of `(.)`.  Thus,

```haskell
lessThan n = (filter . (>)) n
```

And now we can apply [eta-conversion](#eta-conversion):

```haskell
lessThan = filter . (>)
```

Between operator sectioning, the compose combinator `(.)`, and eta-conversion it is possible to write many functions in point-free form.  For example, the flip combinator:

```haskell
flip :: (a -> b -> c) -> b -> a -> c
flip f a b = f b a
```

can also be useful in reversing the arguments of a function or operator in order to get them into a position such that they can be eta-reduced.

In code written by experienced Haskellers it is very common to see functions reduced to point-free form.  Does it make code more readable?  To experienced Haskellers, many times yes.  To novices, perhaps not.  When to do it is a matter of preference.  Experienced Haskellers tend to prefer it: they will argue that it reduces functions like the example one above “to their essence”, removing the “unnecessary plumbing” of explicitly named variables.   Whether you like it or not, it is worth being familiar with the tricks above, because you will undoubtedly see them used in practice.  The other place where point-free style is very useful is when you would otherwise need to use a lambda function.

Some more (and deeper) discussion is available on the Haskell Wiki.

### Exercises

- Refactor the following functions to be point-free. These are clearly extreme examples but is a useful—and easily verified—practice of operator sectioning, composition and eta-conversion.

```haskell
g x y = x^2 + y
```

```haskell
f a b c = (a+b)*c
```

**Extension: Warning, this one scary**
This is very non-assessable, and no one will ask anything harder then first two questions

```haskell
f a b = a*a + b*b
```

#### Solutions

```haskell
g x y = x^2 + y
g x y = (+) (x^2) y -- operator sectioning
g x   = (+) (x^2) -- eta conversion
g x   = (+) ((^2) x) -- operator sectioning
g x   = ((+) . (^2)) x -- composition
g     = (+) . (^2) -- eta conversion
```

```haskell
f a b c = (a+b)*c
f a b c = (*) (a + b) c -- operator sectioning
f a b   = (*) (a + b) -- eta conversion
f a b   = (*) (((+) a) b) -- operator sectioning
f a b   = ((*) . ((+) a)) b -- composition
f a     = (*) . ((+) a) -- eta conversion
f a     = ((*) .) ((+) a)
f a     = (((*) . ) . (+)) a -- composition
f       = ((*) . ) . (+) -- eta conversion
```

Only look at this one if you are curious (very non-assessable, and no one will ask anything harder then first two questions)

```haskell
f a b = a*a + b*b
f a b = (+) (a * a) (b * b)
```

Where do we go from here?
We need a function which applies the `*` function to the same argument `b`
Let’s invent one:

```haskell
apply :: (b -> b -> c) -> b -> c
apply f b = f b b
```

```haskell
f a b = a*a + b*b
f a b = (+) (a * a) (b * b)
f a b = (+) (apply (*) a) (apply (*) b) -- using our apply function
f a b = ((+) (apply (*) a)) ((apply (*)) b) -- this is in the form f (g x), where f == ((+) (apply (*) a)) and g == (apply (*))

f a b = f (g b)
  where
    f = ((+) (apply (*) a))
    g = (apply (*))

f a b = (((+) (apply (*) a)) . (apply (*))) b -- apply function composition
f a = ((+) (apply (*) a)) . (apply (*)) -- eta conversion
f a = (. (apply (*))) ((+) (apply (*) a))  -- operator sectioning
f a = (. (apply (*))) ((+) . (apply (*)) a) -- composition inside brackets ((+) (apply (*) a))
f a = (. (apply (*))) . ((+) . (apply (*))) a -- composition
f = (. (apply (*))) . ((+) . (apply (*))) -- eta conversion
f = (. apply (*)) . (+) . apply (*) -- simplify brackets
```

## Functor

We’ve been mapping over lists and arrays many times, first in JavaScript:

```javascript
console> [1,2,3].map(x=>x+1)
[2,3,4]
```

Now in Haskell:

```haskell
GHCi> map (\i->i+1) [1,2,3]
[2,3,4]
```

Or (eta-reduce the lambda to be point-free):

```haskell
GHCi> map (+1) [1,2,3]
[2,3,4]
```

Here’s the implementation of `map` for lists as it’s [defined in the GHC standard library](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.11.1.0/docs/src/GHC.Base.html#map):

```haskell
map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
map _ []     = []
map f (x:xs) = f x : map f xs
```

It’s easy to generalise this pattern to any data structure that holds one or more values: mapping a function over a data structure creates a new data structure whose elements are the result of applying the function to the elements of the original data structure. We have seen examples of generalising the idea of mapping previously, for example, mapping over a `Tree`.

In Haskell this pattern is captured in a type class called [`Functor`](/assets/WhatTheFunctor.mp3), which defines a function called `fmap`.

```haskell
Prelude> :i Functor
type Functor :: (* -> *) -> Constraint
class Functor f where
  fmap :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
...
instance Functor [] -- naturally lists are an instance
instance Functor Maybe -- but this may surprise!
... -- and some other instances we’ll talk about shortly
```

The first line says that an instance of the Functor typeclass `f` must be over a type that has the [kind](/haskell2#type-kinds) `(* -> *)`, that is, their constructors must be parameterised with a single type variable.  After this, the `class` definition specifies `fmap` as a function that will be available to any instance of Functor and that `f` is the type parameter for the constructor function, which again, takes one type parameter, e.g. `f a` as the input to `fmap`, which returns an `f b`. While this may sound complex and abstract, the power of `fmap` is just applying the idea of a `map` function to any collection of item(s).

Naturally, lists have an instance:

```haskell
Prelude> :i []
...
instance Functor [] -- Defined in `GHC.Base'
```

We can actually look up GHC’s implementation of `fmap` for lists and we see:

```haskell
instance Functor [] where
    fmap = map
```

`fmap` is defined for other types we have seen, such as a `Maybe`. `Maybes` can be considered as a list of 0 items (`Nothing`) or 1 item (`Just`), and therefore, naturally, we should be able to `fmap` over a `Maybe`.

```haskell
instance  Functor Maybe  where
    fmap _ Nothing       = Nothing
    fmap f (Just a)      = Just (f a)
```

We can use `fmap` to apply a function to a `Maybe` value without needing to unpack it. The true power of `fmap` lies in its ability to apply a function to value(s) within a context without requiring knowledge of how to extract those values from the context.

```haskell
GHCi> fmap (+1) (Just 6)
Just 7
```

This is such a common operation that there is an operator alias for fmap: `<$>`

```haskell
GHCi> (+1) <$> (Just 6)
Just 7
```

Which also works over lists:

```haskell
GHCi> (+1) <$> [1,2,3]
[2,3,4]
```

Lists of `Maybe`s frequently arise.  For example, the `mod` operation on integers (e.g. `mod 3 2 == 1`) will throw an error if you pass 0 as the divisor:

```haskell
> mod 3 0
*** Exception: divide by zero
```

We might define a safe modulo function:

```haskell
safeMod :: Integral a => a-> a-> Maybe a
safeMod _ 0 = Nothing
safeMod numerator divisor = Just $ mod numerator divisor
```

This makes it safe to apply `safeMod` to an arbitrary list of `Integral` values:

```haskell
> map (safeMod 3) [1,2,0,4]
[Just 0,Just 1,Nothing,Just 3]
```

But how do we keep working with such a list of `Maybe`s?  We can map an `fmap` over the list:

```haskell
GHCi> map ((+1) <$>) [Just 0,Just 1,Nothing,Just 3]
[Just 1,Just 2,Nothing,Just 4]
```

Or equivalently:

```haskell
GHCi> ((+1) <$>) <$> [Just 0,Just 1,Nothing,Just 3]
[Just 1,Just 2,Nothing,Just 4]
```

In addition to lists and `Maybe`s, a number of other built-in types have instances of `Functor`:

```haskell
GHCi> :i Functor
...
instance Functor (Either a) -- Defined in `Data.Either'
instance Functor IO -- Defined in `GHC.Base'
instance Functor ((->) r) -- Defined in `GHC.Base'
instance Functor ((,) a) -- Defined in `GHC.Base'
```

The definition for functions `(->)` might surprise:

```haskell
instance Functor ((->) r) where
    fmap = (.)
```

So the composition of functions `f` and `g`, `f . g`, is equivalent to “mapping” `f` over `g`, e.g.  `f <$> g`.

```haskell
GHCi> f = (+1)
GHCi> g = (*2)
GHCi> (f.g) 3
7
GHCi> (f<$>g) 3
7
```

### Functor Laws

We can formalise the definition of Functor with two laws:

The law of ***identity***

∀ x: (id <\\$> x) ≡ x

The law of ***composition***

∀ f, g, x: (f ∘ g <\\$> x) ≡ (f <\\$> (g <\\$> x))

(∘ has higher precedence than <\\$>, so f ∘ g <\\$> x is equal to (f ∘ g) <\\$> x.)

Note that these laws are not enforced by the compiler when you create your own instances of `Functor`.  You’ll need to test them for yourself.  Following these laws guarantees that general code (e.g. algorithms) using `fmap` will also work for your own instances of `Functor`.

Let’s make a custom instance of `Functor` for a simple binary tree type and check that the laws hold.  Here’s a simple binary tree data type:

```haskell
data Tree a = Empty
            | Leaf a
            | Node (Tree a) a (Tree a)
  deriving (Show)
```

Note that `Leaf` is a bit redundant as we could also encode nodes with no children as `Node Empty value Empty`—but that’s kind of ugly and makes showing our trees more verbose.  Also, having both `Leaf` and `Empty` provides a nice parallel to `Maybe`.

Here’s an example tree defined:

```haskell
tree = Node (Node (Leaf 1) 2 (Leaf 3)) 4 (Node (Leaf 5) 6 (Leaf 7))
```

And here’s a visualisation of the tree:

```pseudocode
Node 4
 ├──Node 2
 |   ├──Leaf 1
 |   └──Leaf 3
 └──Node 6
     ├──Leaf 5
     └──Leaf 7
```

And here’s the instance of `Functor` for `Tree` that defines `fmap`.

```haskell
instance Functor Tree where
   fmap :: (a -> b) -> Tree a -> Tree b
   fmap _ Empty = Empty
   fmap f (Leaf v) = Leaf $ f v
   fmap f (Node l v r) = Node (fmap f l) (f v) (fmap f r)
```

Just as in the `Maybe` instance above, we use pattern matching to define a case for each possible constructor in the ADT.  The `Empty` and `Leaf` cases are very similar to `Maybe` `fmap` for `Nothing` and `Just` respectively, that is, for `Empty` we just return another `Empty`, for `Leaf` we return a new `Leaf` containing the application of `f` to the value `x` stored in the leaf.  The fun one is `Node`.  As for `Leaf`, `fmap f` of a `Node` returns a new `Node` whose own value is the result of applying `f` to the value stored in the input `Node`, but the left and right children of the new node will be the recursive application of `fmap f` to the children of the input node.

Now we’ll demonstrate (but not prove) that the two laws hold at least for our example tree:

Law of Identity:

```haskell
> id <$> tree
Node (Node (Leaf 1) 2 (Leaf 3)) 4 (Node (Leaf 5) 6 (Leaf 7))
```

Law of Composition:

```haskell
> (+1) <$> ((*2) <$> tree)
Node (Node (Leaf 3) 5 (Leaf 7)) 9 (Node (Leaf 11) 13 (Leaf 15))
> (+1).(*2) <$> tree
Node (Node (Leaf 3) 5 (Leaf 7)) 9 (Node (Leaf 11) 13 (Leaf 15))
```

## Applicative

The typeclass `Applicative` introduces a new operator `<*>` (pronounced “apply”), which lets us apply functions inside a computational context.

Applicative is a “subclass” of `Functor`, meaning that an instance of `Applicative` can be `fmap`ed over, but Applicatives also declare (at least) two additional functions, `pure` and `(<*>)` (pronounced “apply”—but I like calling it [“TIE Fighter”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIE_fighter)):

```haskell
GHCi> :i Applicative
class Functor f => Applicative (f :: * -> *) where
  pure :: a -> f a
  (<*>) :: f (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
```

As for `Functor` all instances of the Applicative type-class must satisfy certain laws, which again are not checked by the compiler.
Applicative instances must comply with these laws to produce the expected behaviour.
You can [read about the Applicative Laws](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Applicative_functors)
if you are interested, but they are a little more subtle than the basic Functor laws above, and it is
not essential to understand them to be able to use `<*>` in Haskell.

As for `Functor`, many Base Haskell types are also `Applicative`, e.g. `[]`, `Maybe`, `IO` and `(->)`.

For example, a function inside a `Maybe` can be applied to a value in a `Maybe`.

```haskell
GHCi> Just (+3) <*> Just 2
Just 5
```

Or a list of functions `[(+1),(+2)]` to things inside a similar context (e.g. a list `[1,2,3]`).

```haskell
> [(+1),(+2)] <*> [1,2,3]
[2,3,4,3,4,5]
```

Note that list’s definition of `<*>` produces the Cartesian product of the two lists, that is, all the possible ways to apply the functions in the left list to the values in the right list.  It is interesting to look at [the source](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.14.0.0/docs/src/GHC.Base.html#Applicative) for the definition of `Applicative` for lists on Hackage:

```haskell
instance Applicative [] where
  pure x    = [x]
  fs <*> xs = [f x | f <- fs, x <- xs]  -- list comprehension
```

The definition of `<*>` for lists uses a list comprehension.  List comprehensions are a short-hand way to generate lists, using notation similar to mathematical [“set builder notation”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set-builder_notation).  The set builder notation here would be:  `{f(x) |  f ∈ fs ∧ x ∈ xs}`.  In English it means: “the set (Haskell list) of all functions in `fs` applied to all values in `xs`”.

A common use-case for Applicative is applying a binary (two-parameter) function over two Applicative values, e.g.:

```haskell
> pure (+) <*> Just 3 <*> Just 2
Just 5
```

So:

- `pure` puts the binary function into the applicative (i.e. `pure (+) :: Maybe (Num -> Num -> Num)`),
- then `<*>`ing this function inside over the first `Maybe` value `Just 3` achieves a partial application of the function inside the `Maybe`. This gives a unary function inside a `Maybe`: i.e. `Just (3+) :: Maybe (Num->Num)`.
- Finally, we `<*>` this function inside a `Maybe` over the remaining `Maybe` value.

This is where the name “applicative” comes from, i.e. `Applicative` is a type over which a non-unary function may be applied.  Note that the following use of `<$>` (infix `fmap`) is equivalent and a little bit more concise:

```haskell
> (+) <$> Just 3 <*> Just 2
Just 5
```

This is also called “lifting” a function over an Applicative.  Actually, it’s so common that Applicative also defines dedicated functions for lifting binary functions (in the GHC.Base module):

```haskell
> GHC.Base.liftA2 (+) (Just 3) (Just 2)
Just 5
```

Here’s a little visual summary of Applicative and lifting (box metaphor inspired by [adit.io](http://www.adit.io/posts/2013-04-17-functors,_applicatives,_and_monads_in_pictures.html)):

![Applicative Visual Summary](/assets/images/chapterImages/haskell3/applicativePicture.png)

It’s also useful to lift binary data constructors over two Applicative values, e.g. for tuples:

```haskell
> (,) <$> Just 3 <*> Just 2
Just (3, 2)
```

We can equally well apply functions with more than two arguments over the correct number of values inside Applicative contexts.
Recall our student data type:

```haskell
data Student = Student { id::Integer, name::String, mark::Int }
```

with a ternary constructor:

```haskell
Student::Integer -> String -> Int -> Student
```

Let’s say we want to create a student for a given `id` but we need to look up the name and mark from tables, i.e. lists of key-value pairs:
`names::[(Integer,String)]` and `marks::[(Integer,Int)]`.  We’ll use the function `lookup :: Eq a => a -> [(a, b)] -> Maybe b`, which will either succeed with `Just` the result, or fail to find the value for a given key, and return `Nothing`.

```haskell
lookupStudent :: Integer -> Maybe Student
lookupStudent sid = Student sid <$> lookup sid names <*> lookup sid marks
```

<!-- The following example doesn’t typecheck. Commented it out for now.

What if `sid` is also the result of some computation that may fail, and is therefore itself wrapped in a `Maybe` context?  Then we will need to apply the ternary `Student` constructor over three `Maybe`s:

```haskell
lookupStudent :: Maybe Integer -> Maybe Student
lookupStudent sid = Student <$> sid <*> lookup sid names <*> lookup sid marks
```

So we can see `<*>` may be chained as many times as necessary to cover all the arguments.
-->

Lists are also instances of `Applicative`.  Given the following types:

```haskell
data Suit = Spade|Club|Diamond|Heart
 deriving (Eq,Ord,Enum,Bounded)

instance Show Suit where
 show Spade = "^"     -- ♠  (closest I could come in ASCII was ^)
 show Club = "&"      -- ♣
 show Diamond = "O"   -- ♦
 show Heart = "V"     -- ♥

data Rank = Two|Three|Four|Five|Six|Seven|Eight|Nine|Ten|Jack|Queen|King|Ace
 deriving (Eq,Ord,Enum,Show,Bounded)

data Card = Card Suit Rank
 deriving (Eq, Ord, Show)
```

We can make one card using the Card constructor:

```haskell
GHCi> Card Spade Ace
Card ^ Ace
```

Or, since both `Suit` and `Rank` derive `Enum`, we can enumerate the full lists of `Suit`s and `Rank`s, and then lift the `Card` operator over both lists to create a whole deck:

```haskell
GHCi> Card <$> [Spade ..] <*> [Two ..]
[Card ^ Two,Card ^ Three,Card ^ Four,Card ^ Five,Card ^ Six,Card ^ Seven,Card ^ Eight,Card ^ Nine,Card ^ Ten,Card ^ Jack,Card ^ Queen,Card ^ King,Card ^ Ace,Card & Two,Card & Three,Card & Four,Card & Five,Card & Six,Card & Seven,Card & Eight,Card & Nine,Card & Ten,Card & Jack,Card & Queen,Card & King,Card & Ace,Card O Two,Card O Three,Card O Four,Card O Five,Card O Six,Card O Seven,Card O Eight,Card O Nine,Card O Ten,Card O Jack,Card O Queen,Card O King,Card O Ace,Card V Two,Card V Three,Card V Four,Card V Five,Card V Six,Card V Seven,Card V Eight,Card V Nine,Card V Ten,Card V Jack,Card V Queen,Card V King,Card V Ace]
```

---

### Exercise

- Create instances of `Show` for `Rank` and `Card` such that a deck of cards displays much more succinctly, e.g.:

```haskell
[^2,^3,^4,^5,^6,^7,^8,^9,^10,^J,^Q,^K,^A,&2,&3,&4,&5,&6,&7,&8,&9,&10,&J,&Q,&K,&A,O2,O3,O4,O5,O6,O7,O8,O9,O10,OJ,OQ,OK,OA,V2,V3,V4,V5,V6,V7,V8,V9,V10,VJ,VQ,VK,VA]
```

- Try and make the definition of `show` for `Rank` a one-liner using `zip` and `lookup`.

#### Solutions

```haskell
instance Show Suit where
    show Spade = "^"     -- Represents Spades
    show Club = "&"      -- Represents Clubs
    show Diamond = "O"   -- Represents Diamonds
    show Heart = "V"     -- Represents Hearts

instance Show Rank where
    show Two = "2"
    show Three = "3"
    show Four = "4"
    show Five = "5"
    show Six = "6"
    show Seven = "7"
    show Eight = "8"
    show Nine = "9"
    show Ten = "10"
    show Jack = "J"
    show Queen = "Q"
    show King = "K"
    show Ace = "A"

instance Show Card where
    show (Card s r) = show s ++ show r
```

To define the show method for Rank as a one-liner using `zip` and `lookup`, we can leverage these functions to directly map the Rank constructors to their respective string representations.

```haskell
instance Show Rank where
    show r = fromMaybe "" $ lookup r (zip [Two .. Ace] ["2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10", "J", "Q", "K", "A"])
```

## Equivalent Definition of Applicative

Feel free to skip this definition if the previous one made sense. But, here is an alternative definition if it helps you.

There is an alternative way to think about applicatives, which highlights (arguably) the main usage of applicative.

```haskell
class Functor f => Applicative f where
  pure   :: a -> f a
  liftA2 :: (a -> b -> c) -> f a -> f b -> f c
```

This definition says: we’re extending the idea of Functor (which allows you to apply a one-argument function to a value in a context) to two-argument functions.

Recall that:

```haskell
(<$>) :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
```

`liftA2` is just the natural next step in this pattern.

For example, here’s the instance for `Maybe`, which follows the same pattern as `fmap`, just extended to two inputs:

```haskell
instance Applicative Maybe where
  pure = Just
  liftA2 f (Just x) (Just y) = Just (f x y)
  liftA2 _ _ _ = Nothing
```

So `Applicative` gives us the power to apply two arguments in context to a function. Since we have two, we can also extend this to three, but we don’t need a new mechanism: we can keep applying functions to multiple arguments by combining `liftA2` in a nested way. In other words, once we've applied a function to two contextual values using `liftA2`, the result is a new function still inside the context, and we can use liftA2 again to apply that to a third value — and so on.

### Can we recover the tie-fighter from liftA2?

We can define `<*>` using `liftA2`, we can rephrase the `Applicative` definition like this:

```haskell
-- Default implementation of <*>
(<*>) :: f (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
(<*>) ff fa = liftA2 (\f a -> f a) ff fa
```

Let’s unpack it:

- `ff` is a function inside a context (i.e., `Just (+1)`)
- `fa` is a value inside a context (i.e., `Just 3`)
- `liftA2 (\f a -> f a)` says, apply the function `f` to the value (i.e., `(+1) 3` which will equate to 4)

One thing we can observe is that `(\f a -> f a)` is the same thing as `($)`. So, we can simplify this to

```haskell
-- Default implementation of <*>
(<*>) :: f (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
-- (<*>) ff fa = liftA2 ($) ff fa
-- ETA REDUCTION:
(<*>) = liftA2 ($)
```

### Different Ways To Apply Functions Cheatsheet

```haskell
 g x         -- apply function g to argument x
 g $ x       -- apply function g to argument x
 g <$> f x   -- apply function g to argument x which is inside Functor f
 f g <*> f x -- apply function g in Applicative context f to argument x which is also inside f
```

</div>

We saw that functions `(->)` are Functors, such that `(<$>)=(.)`.  There is also an instance of Applicative for functions of input type `r`.  We’ll give the types of the essential functions for the instance:

```haskell
instance Applicative ((->)r) where
  pure :: a -> (r->a)
  (<*>) :: (r -> (a -> b)) -> (r -> a) -> (r -> b)
```

This is very convenient for creating point-free implementations of functions that operate on their parameters more than once.  For example, imagine our `Student` type from above has additional fields with breakdowns of marks: e.g. `exam` and `nonExam`, requiring a function to compute the total mark:

```haskell
totalMark :: Student -> Int
totalMark s = exam s + nonExam s
```

Here’s the point-free version, taking advantage of the fact that `exam` and `nonExam`, both being functions of the same input type `Student`, are both in the same Applicative context:

```haskell
totalMark = (+) <$> exam <*> nonExam
```

Or equivalently:

```haskell
totalMark = (+) . exam <*> nonExam
```

### Applicative Exercises

- Derive the implementations of `pure` and `<*>` for `Maybe` and for functions `((->)r)`.

#### Solutions

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD036 -->

**Maybes**

First let’s consider `Maybe`. The type signature for `pure` is:

```haskell
pure :: a -> Maybe a
```

The idea behind `pure` is to take the value of type `a` and put it inside the context. So, we take the value `x` and put it inside the `Just` constructor.

```haskell
pure :: a -> Maybe a
pure x = Just x
```

A simple way to define this is to consider all possible options of the two parameters, and define the behaviour
by following the types

```haskell
(<*>) :: Maybe (a -> b) -> Maybe a -> Maybe b
```

```haskell
(<*>) :: Maybe (a -> b) -> Maybe a -> Maybe b
(<*>) (Just a) (Just b) = Just (a b) -- We can apply the function to the value, we have both!
(<*>) Nothing (Just b) = Nothing -- Do not have the function, so all we can do is return Nothing
(<*>) (Just a) Nothing = Nothing -- Do not have the value, so all we can do is return Nothing
(<*>) Nothing Nothing = Nothing -- Do not have value or function, not much we can do here...
```

We observe that only one case returns a value, while all other cases, return `Nothing`, so we can simplify our code using the wildcard `_` when pattern matching.

```haskell
(<*>) :: Maybe (a -> b) -> Maybe a -> Maybe b
(<*>) (Just a) (Just b) = Just (a b) -- We can apply the function to the value, we have both!
(<*>) _ _ = Nothing -- All other cases, return Nothing
```

**Functions**

The type definitions for the function type `((->)r)` is a bit more nuanced. When we write `((->) r)`, we are partially applying the `->` type constructor. The `->` type constructor takes two type arguments: an argument type and a return type. By supplying only the first argument `r`, we get a type constructor that still needs one more type to become a complete type.

For a bit of intuition around we can make a function in instance of the applicative instance, you can consider the context is an *environment r*. The `pure` function for the reader applicative takes a value and creates a function that ignores the environment and always returns that value. The `<*>` function for the function instance combines two functions that depend on the *same environment*.

First, let’s consider `pure`.

```haskell
pure :: a -> (((->)r) a)
```

This may look confusing, but if you replace `((->)r)` with `Maybe`, you can see it is essentially the same. Similar to converting prefix functions to infix, we can do the same thing with the type operation here, therefore, this is equivalent to:

```haskell
pure :: a -> (r -> a)
```

We can follow the types to write a definition for this:

```haskell
pure :: a -> (r -> a)
pure a = \r -> a
```

This definition takes a single parameter a and returns a function. This function, when given any parameter r, will return the original parameter a. Since all functions are curried in Haskell, this is equivalent to:

```haskell
pure :: a -> (r -> a)
pure a _ = -> a
```

The function `pure` helps you create a function that, no matter what the second input is, will always return this first value, this is exactly the K-combinator.

---

As a reminder, the definition for `<*>` is:

```haskell
(<*>) :: (f (a -> b)) -> (f a) -> (f b)
```

For the function applicative, our `f` is `((->)r)`

```haskell
(<*>) :: (((->) r) (a -> b)) -> (((->) r) a) -> (((->) r) b)
```

Converting the type signature to use `(->)` infix rather than prefix

```haskell
(<*>) :: (r -> (a -> b)) -> (r -> a) -> (r -> b)
```

For the function body, our function takes two arguments and returns a function of type `r -> b`.

We have to do some [Lego](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*JHP0yCvsO6BD4YxtJs-M1Q.jpeg) to fit the variables together to get out the correct type `b`.

```haskell
(<*>) :: (r -> (a -> b)) -> (r -> a) -> (r -> b)
(<*>) f g = \r -> (f r) (g r)
```

The function `(<*>)` takes two functions, one of type `r -> (a -> b)` and another of type `r -> a`, and combines them to produce a new function of type `r -> b`. It does this by applying both functions to the same input `r` and then applying the result of the first function to the result of the second.

One neat function we can make out of this, which we will call `apply`, passes one argument to a binary function twice, which can be a useful trick.

```haskell
apply :: (b -> b -> c) -> b -> c
apply f b = (f <*> (\x -> x)) b
```

or more simply:

```haskell
apply :: (b -> b -> c) -> b -> c
apply f = f <*> id
```

This will allow us to make more functions point-free

```haskell
square :: Num a => a => a
square a = a * a
```

```haskell
square a = apply (*) a
square = apply (*)
```
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD036 -->

## Alternative

The Alternative typeclass is another important typeclass in Haskell, which is closely related to the Applicative typeclass. It introduces a set of operators and functions that are particularly useful when dealing with computations that can fail or have multiple possible outcomes. Alternative is also considered a “subclass” of Applicative, and it provides additional capabilities beyond what Applicative offers. It introduces two main functions, `empty` and `<|>` (pronounced “alt” or “alternative”)

```haskell
class Applicative f => Alternative (f :: * -> *) where
  empty :: f a
  (<|>) :: f a -> f a -> f a
```

`empty`: This function represents a computation with either *no result, or a failure*. It serves as the identity element. For different data types that are instances of Alternative, `empty` represents an empty container or a *failed computation*, depending on the context.

`(<|>)`: The `<|>` operator combines two computations, and it’s used to express alternatives. It takes two computations of the same type and returns a computation that will produce a result from the first computation if it succeeds, or if it fails, it will produce a result from the second computation. This operator allows you to handle branching logic and alternative paths in your code.

Like Functor and Applicative, instances of the Alternative typeclass must also adhere to specific laws, ensuring predictable behaviour when working with alternatives. Common instances of the Alternative typeclass include Maybe and lists (`[]`). Alternatives are also very useful for *Parsers*, where we try to run first parser, if it fails, we run the second parser.

```haskell
> Just 2 <|> Just 5
Just 2

> Nothing <|> Just 5
Just 5
```

---

### Exercise

- One useful function, which will be coming up throughout the semester is `asum` with the type definition `asum :: Alternative f => [f a] -> f a`. Write this function using `foldr`.

#### Solutions

A naive approach will be to use recursion (recursion is hard).

```haskell
asum :: Alternative f => [f a] -> f a
asum [] = empty -- When we reach empty list, return the empty alternative
asum (x:xs) = x <|> asum xs -- Otherwise recursively combine the first value and the rest of the list
```

However, you may recognise this pattern of recursion to a base case, combining current value with an accumulated value.

This is a classic example of a *foldr*

Therefore we can write `asum` simply as:

```haskell
asum :: Alternative f => [f a] -> f a
asum = foldr (<|>) empty
```

## A simple Applicative Functor for Parsing

As we will [discuss in more detail later](/parsercombinators), a parser is a program that takes some structured input and does something with it.  When we say “structured input” we typically mean something like a string that follows strict rules about its syntax, like source code in a particular programming language, or a file format like JSON.  A parser for a given syntax is a program that you run over some input and if the input is valid, it will do something sensible with it (like give us back some data), or fail: preferably in a way that we can handle gracefully.

In Haskell, sophisticated parsers are often constructed from simple functions that try to read a certain element of the expected input and either succeed in consuming that input, returning a tuple containing the rest of the input string and the resultant data, or they fail, producing nothing.  We’ve already seen one type which can be used to encode success or failure, namely `Maybe`.  Here’s the most trivial parser function I can think of. It tries to take a character from the input stream and either succeeds, consuming it, or fails if it’s given an empty string:

```haskell
-- >>> parseChar "abc"
-- Just ("bc",'a')
-- >>> parseChar ""
-- Nothing
parseChar :: String -> Maybe (String, Char)
parseChar "" = Nothing
parseChar (c:rest) = Just (rest, c)
```

And here’s one to parse `Int`s off the input stream.  It uses the `reads` function from the Prelude:

```haskell
-- >>> parseInt "123+456"
-- Just ("+456",123)
-- >>> parseInt "xyz456"
-- Nothing
parseInt :: String -> Maybe (String, Int)
parseInt s = case reads s of
  [(x, rest)] -> Just (rest, x)
  _           -> Nothing
```

So now we could combine these to try to build a little calculator language (OK, all it can do is add two integers, but you get the idea):

```haskell
-- >>> parsePlus "123+456"
-- Just ("",579)
parsePlus :: String -> Maybe (String, Int)
parsePlus s =
    case parseInt s of
        Just (s', x) -> case parseChar s' of
            Just (s'', '+') -> case parseInt s'' of
                Just (s''',y) -> Just (s''',x+y)
                Nothing -> Nothing
            Nothing -> Nothing
        Nothing -> Nothing
```

But that’s not very elegant and Haskell is all about elegant simplicity.  So how can we use Haskell’s typeclass system to make parsers that are more easily combined?  We’ve seen how things that are instances of the `Functor` and `Applicative` typeclasses can be combined—so let’s make a type definition for parsers and then make it an instance of `Functor` and `Applicative`.  Here’s a generic type for parsers:

```haskell
newtype Parser a = Parser (String -> Maybe (String, a))
```

We can now make concrete parsers for `Int` and `Char` using our previous functions, which conveniently already had functions in the form `(String -> Maybe (String, a))`:

```haskell
char :: Parser Char
char = Parser parseChar
int :: Parser Int
int = Parser parseInt
```

And here’s a simple generic function we can use to run these parsers. All this does is extract the inner function `p` from the `Parser` constructor:

```haskell
-- >>> parse int "123+456"
-- Just ("+456",123)
parse :: Parser a -> String -> Maybe (String, a)
parse (Parser p) = p
```

And a parser which asserts the next character on the stream is the one we are expecting:

```haskell
is :: Char -> Parser Char
is c = Parser $
  \inputString -> case parse char inputString of
    Just (rest, result) | result == c -> Just (rest, result)
    _ -> Nothing
```

<div class="alert-box alert-info" markdown="1">
**Aside: How do we get to that parser?**

The `is` function constructs a parser that succeeds and consumes a character from the input string if it matches the specified character c, otherwise it fails.

```haskell
-- >>> parse (is '+') "+456"
-- Just ("456",'+')
-- >>> parse (is '-') "+456"
-- Nothing
is :: Char -> Parser Char
is c = Parser $ \inputString ->
  case inputString of
    [] -> Nothing
    (x:xs) -> case x == c of
      True  -> Just (xs, x)
      False -> Nothing
```

However, this is quickly becoming very deeply nested. Let’s use our previous `char` parser to ensure correct behaviour for the empty string, rather than duplicating that logic.

```haskell
-- >>> parse (is '+') "+456"
-- Just ("456",'+')
-- >>> parse (is '-') "+456"
-- Nothing
is :: Char -> Parser Char
is c = Parser $
  \inputString -> case parse char inputString of
    Just (rest, result)
      | result == c -> Just (rest, result)
      | otherwise = Nothing
    _ -> Nothing
```

In this example, the `otherwise = Nothing` guard is not needed, as our `case` statement can handle that in the wildcard statement

```haskell
is :: Char -> Parser Char
is c = Parser $
  \inputString -> case parse char inputString of
    Just (rest, result) | result == c -> Just (rest, result)
    _ -> Nothing
```

</div>

By making `Parser` an instance of `Functor`, we will be able to map functions over the result of a parse. This is very useful! For example, consider the `int` parser, which parses a string to an `integer`, and if we want to apply a function to the result, such as adding 1 `(+1)`, we can fmap this over the parser.

```haskell
add1 :: Parser Int
add1 = (+1) <$> int
```

We can now use this to parse a string “12”, and get the result 13. `parse add1 "12"` will result in `13`

The `fmap` function for the `Functor` instance of `Parser` needs to apply the parser to an input string and apply the given function to the result of the parse, i.e.:

```haskell
instance Functor Parser where
  fmap f (Parser p) = Parser $
    \inputString -> 
      case p inputString of
        Just (rest, result) -> Just (rest, f result)
        _ -> Nothing
```
These definition is a bit tedious.  We have to explicitly run the parser and unbox the result of the given parser (but only if it succeeds), in order to apply the function f to the result.

If we take advantage of the fact that everything buried away inside the `Parser` is also an instance `Functor`, we can have a much simpler definition of `fmap` for `Parser`:

```haskell
instance Functor Parser where
  fmap f (Parser p) = Parser $ f (fmap.fmap.fmap) p
```

---

**Exercise:** derive this short definition of `fmap` for `Parser`, from the previous longer version by introducing one nested `fmap` at a time.

### Solutions

**`fmap` over `Tuple`:**
We can take advantage of the fact that the `Tuple` returned by the parse function is also an instance of `Functor`.  That is, we are applying the function `f` to the second item of a tuple—that is exactly what the `fmap` for the `Functor` instance of a `Tuple` does! So we can rewrite to use the `Tuple` `fmap`, or rather its alias `(<$>)`:

```haskell
instance Functor Parser where
  fmap f (Parser p) = Parser $
    \i -> case p i of
      Just (rest, result) -> Just (f <$> (rest, result))
      _ -> Nothing
```

**`fmap` over `Maybe`:**
Carefully examining this, what we are doing is applying `(f <$>)` if the result is a `Just`, or ignoring if the result is `Nothing`. This is exactly what the `Maybe` instance of `Functor` does, so we can `fmap` over the `Maybe` also:

```haskell
instance Functor Parser where
  fmap f (Parser p) = Parser (\i -> (f <$>) <$> p i )
```

**eta reduce:**
Let’s try rearrange to make it point [point-free](/haskell3/#point-free-code), eliminating the lambda.
First, let’s add some brackets, to make the evaluation order more explicit.

```haskell
instance Functor Parser where
  fmap f (Parser p) = Parser (\i -> ((f <$>) <$>) (p i))
```

This is now in the form  `(f . g) i)` where `f` is equal to `((f <$>) <$>)` and g is equal to `p`. Therefore:

```haskell
instance Functor Parser where
  fmap f (Parser p) = Parser (\i -> (((f <$>) <$>) . p) i)
```

And, if we eta-reduce:

```haskell
instance Functor Parser where
  fmap f (Parser p) = Parser (((f <$>) <$>) . p)
```

**`fmap` over `Function`:**
The last thing we notice is that the `Functor` instance for functions is defined as compose. Therefore, we have finally reached the end of our journey and can rewrite this as follows.

```haskell
-- >>> parse ((*2) <$> int) "123+456"
-- Just ("+456",246)
instance Functor Parser where
  fmap f (Parser p) = Parser (((f <$>) <$>) <$> p)
```

The whacky triple-nested application of `<$>` comes about because the result type `a` in our `Parser` type is nested inside a Tuple (`(,a)`), nested inside a `Maybe`, nested inside a function (`->r`).  

---

So now we can map (or `fmap`, to be precise) a function over the value produced by a `Parser`.  For example:

```haskell
> parse ((+1)<$>int) "1bc"
Just ("bc",2)
```

So `(+1)<$>int` creates a new `Parser` which parses an `int` from the input stream and adds one to the value parsed (if it succeeds).  Behind the scenes, using the implementation above, the `Parser`’s instance of Functor is effectively lifting over three additional layers of nested types to reach the `Int` value, i.e.:

![Applicative Visual Summary](/assets/images/chapterImages/haskell3/parserfunctor.png)

Just as we have seen before, making our `Parser` an instance of `Applicative` is going to let us do nifty things like lifting a binary function over the results of two `Parser`s.  Thus, instead of implementing all the messy logic of connecting two Parsers to make `plus` above, we’ll be able to lift `(+)` over two `Parser`s.

Now the definition for the `Applicative` is going to stitch together all the messy bits of handling both the `Just` and `Nothing` cases of the `Maybe` that we saw above in the definition of `plus`, abstracting it out so that people implementing parsers like `plus` won’t have to:

```haskell
instance Applicative Parser where
  pure a = Parser (\b -> Just (b, a))

  (Parser f) <*> (Parser g) = Parser $
    \i -> case f i of                                       -- note that this is just
      Just (r1, p1) -> case g r1 of                         -- an abstraction of the
        Just (r2, p2) -> Just (r2, p1 p2)                   -- logic we saw in `plus`
        Nothing       -> Nothing
      Nothing -> Nothing
```

All that `pure` does is put the given value on the right side of the tuple.

The key insight for this applicative instance is that we first use `f` (the parser on the LHS of `<*>`). This consumes input from `i`, giving back the remaining input in `r1`. We then run the second parser `g` on the RHS of `<*>` on `r1` (the remaining input).

The main takeaway message is that `<*>` allows us to combine two parsers in sequence, that is, we can run the first one and then the second one.

Alternatively, we can think about this in terms of `liftA2`:

```haskell
instance Applicative Parser where
  pure a = Parser (\input -> Just (input, a))

  liftA2 f (Parser pa) (Parser pb) = Parser $ \input ->
    case pa input of
      Just (rest1, a) -> case pb rest1 of
        Just (rest2, b) -> Just (rest2, f a b)
        Nothing         -> Nothing
      Nothing -> Nothing
```

So, `liftA2` lets us run two parsers in *sequence* and then combine their results with a regular two-argument function — all without manually handling the `Maybe` logic.

Let’s walk through a concrete example of this.

```haskell
> charIntPairParser = (,) <$> char <*> int
> parse charIntPairParser "a12345b"
Just ("b",('a',12345))
```

As both `<$>` and `<*>` have the same precedence, firstly `(,) <$> char` will be evaluated, and then the result will be applied to `int`.

So how does `(,) <$> char` work? Well, we parse a character and then make that character the first item of a tuple, therefore:

```haskell
> charPairParser = (,) <$> char
> :t charPairParser
charPairParser :: Parser (b -> (Char, b))
```

So for the applicative instance, the LHS will be the `charPairParser` and the RHS will be `int`.
That is, the first step in applicative parsing is to parse the input `i` using the LHS parser, which is what we called here `charPairParser`.
This will match the `Just (r1, p1)` case where it will be equal to `Just ("12345b", ('a',))`. Therefore, `r1` is equal to the unparsed portion of the input `12345b` and the result is a tuple partially applied `('a', )`.

We then run the second parser `int` on the remaining input `"12345b"`. This will match the `Just (r2, p2)` case where it will be equal to `Just ("b", 12345)`, where `r2` is equal to the remaining input `"b"` and `p2` is equal to `"12345"`

We then return `Just (r2, p1 p2)`, which will evaluate to `Just ("b", ('a',12345))`.

Using the `<*>` operator we can make our calculator magnificently simple:

```haskell
-- >>> parse plus "123+456"
-- Just ("",579)
plus :: Parser Int
plus = (+) <$> int <*> (is '+' *> int)
```

Note that we make use of a different version of the applicative operator here: `*>`.  Note also that we didn’t have to provide an implementation of `*>` - rather, the typeclass system picks up a default implementation of this operator (and a bunch of other functions too) from the base definition of `Applicative`.  These default implementations are able to make use of the `<*>` that we provided for our instance of `Applicative` for `Parser`.

```haskell
Prelude> :t (*>)
(*>) :: Applicative f => f a -> f b -> f b
```

So, compared to `<*>` which took a function inside the `Applicative` as its first parameter which is applied to the value inside the `Applicative` of its second parameter,
the `*>` carries through the effect of the first `Applicative`, but doesn’t do anything else with the value.  You can think of it as a simple chaining of effectful operations: “do the first effectful thing, then do the second effectful thing, but give back the result of the second thing only”.

In the context of the `Parser` instance, when we do things like `(is '+' *> int)`, we try the `is`.  If it succeeds then we carry on and run the `int`.  But if the `is` fails, execution is short-circuited and we return `Nothing`.  There is also a flipped version of the operator which works the other way:

```haskell
Prelude> :t (<*)
(<*) :: Applicative f => f a -> f b -> f a
```

So we could have just as easily implemented the `plus` parser:

```haskell
-- >>> parse plus "123+456"
-- Just ("",579)
plus :: Parser Int
plus = (+) <$> int <* is '+'  <*> int
```

Obviously, the above is not a fully featured parsing system.  A real parser would need to give us more information in the case of failure, so a `Maybe` is not really a sufficiently rich type to package the result.  Also, a real language would need to be able to handle alternatives - e.g. `minus` or `plus`, as well as expressions with an arbitrary number of terms.  We will revisit all of these topics with a more feature-rich set of [parser combinators later](/parsercombinators).

### Left and Right Applicatives

We briefly introduced both `(<*)` and `(*>)` but let’s deep dive in to why these functions are so useful. The full type definitions are:

```haskell
(<*) :: Applicative f => f a -> f b -> f a
(*>) :: Applicative f => f a -> f b -> f b
```

A more intuitive look at these would be:

- `(<*)`: Executes two actions, but only returns the result of the first action.
- `(*>)`: Executes two actions, but only returns the result of the second action.

The key term here is *action*. We can consider the *action* of our parser as doing the *parsing*.

A definition of `(<*)` is

```haskell
(<*) :: Applicative f => f a -> f b -> f a
(<*) fa fb = liftA2 (\a b -> a) fa fb
```

where `liftA2 = f <$> a <*> b`.

Let’s relate this to our parsing and how this *executes* the two actions. We will consider the example of parsing something in the form of “123+”, wanting to parse the number and ignore the “+”. The execution order will be changed around a little bit, hoping to provide some intuition into these functions.

So, we can use our `<*` to ignore the second action, i.e., `int <* (is '+')`.

Plugging this into the `liftA2` definition:

```haskell
liftA2 (\a _ -> a) int (is '+')
(\a b -> a) <$> int <*> (is '+') -- from the liftA2 definition
((\a b -> a) <$> int) <*> (is '+') -- we will complete the functor operator first
```

Recall the definition of `Functor` for parsing:

```haskell
instance Functor Parser where
  fmap f (Parser p) = Parser $
    \i -> case p i of
      Just (rest, result) -> Just (rest, f result)
      _ -> Nothing
```

So in this scenario, our function `f` is `(\a b -> a)` and our `(Parser p)` is the `int` parser. `i` is the input string “123+”.

Therefore, `(\a b -> a) <$> int` will result in `Just ("+", (\a b -> a) 123)`

Now, we want need to consider the second half, which is

`Just ("+", (\a b -> a) 123)` being applied to `(is '+')`

The applicative definition says to apply the second parser `is '+'` to the remaining input, and apply the result to the function inside the RHS of the tuple.

Therefore, after applying this parser, it will result in: `Just ("", (\a b -> a) 123 "+")`. Finally, we will apply the function call to ignore the second value, finally resulting in: `Just ("", 123)`. But the key point is we still *executed* the `is '+'`, but we ignored the value. That is the beauty of using our `<*` and `*>` to ignore results while still *executing* actions.

## Glossary

*Operator Sectioning*: The process of partially applying an infix operator in Haskell by specifying one of its arguments. For example, (+1) is a section of the addition operator with 1 as the second argument.

*Compose Operator*: Represented as (.) in Haskell, it allows the composition of two functions, where the output of the second function is passed as the input to the first function.

*Point-Free Code*: A style of defining functions without mentioning their arguments explicitly. This often involves the use of function composition and other combinators.

*Functor*: A type class in Haskell that represents types that can be mapped over. Instances of Functor must define the fmap function, which applies a function to every element in a structure.

*Applicative*: A type class in Haskell that extends Functor, allowing functions that are within a context to be applied to values that are also within a context. Applicative defines the functions pure and (<*>).

*Lifting*: The process of applying a function to arguments that are within a context, such as a Functor or Applicative.

*Alternative*: A type class in Haskell that extends Applicative, introducing the empty and \<\|\> functions for representing computations that can fail or have multiple outcomes.

*Parser*: A function or program that interprets structured input, often used to convert strings into data structures.

*Parser Combinator*: A higher-order function that takes parsers as input and returns a new parser as output. Parser combinators are used to build complex parsers from simpler ones.
